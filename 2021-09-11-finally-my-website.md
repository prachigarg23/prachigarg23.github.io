They say that if you have to go back to something again and again, and learn it more than twice, it's time you blogged it. I've been wanting to make my own personal website for the past several months and its finally here! I've felt the urge to blog on some really interesting topics for a long time. I have decided to share some of my personal documentation, notes about my areas of interest in machine learning research, paper reviews, my thoughts on research in general and my personal experiences with the world. Hopefully, this will serve as a place for me to share my learnings and connect with other people who find these ideas interesting.  

<p> New blogs coming soon! </p>
